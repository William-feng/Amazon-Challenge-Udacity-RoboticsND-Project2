### Overview

###### The goal of this project is to program a Serial Manipulator to pick up objects and place them in a bin. The project is based on Amazon's Pick and Place Challenge.


##### Specifically, the objectives of this project are to:
	1. Identify the location of a single object on a 9-position shelf(3x3 configuration)
	2. Maneuver the Kuka KR210 - a 6 degree of freedom Serial Manipulator - toward the object
	3. Grasp the object
	4. Chart a path to the destination bin
	5. Maneuver the Kuka KR210 along the charted path
	6. Sucessfully place the object in the destination bin

The code driving this project and interacting with ROS can be found at `IK_server.py`


### Environment Setup

`Robotic VM V2.0.1` is the directory that contains the Linux Boot image:`Ubuntu 64-bit Robo V2.0.1.ova`

If prompted, the Linux system password is `robo-nd`
